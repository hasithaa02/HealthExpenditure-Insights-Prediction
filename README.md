# HealthExpenditure Insights & Prediction (HEIP)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Data Preprocessing & Learning (DPL)** for healthcare expenditure data. The goal is to analyze trends, detect patterns, clean data, and build a machine learning model to predict **Current Health Expenditure (CHE)** based on various economic factors.

## 🛠 Features

- **EDA:** Visualizations of key metrics, distribution analysis, and correlation heatmaps.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outlier removal, and feature encoding.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Uses **Random Forest Regressor** for prediction.
- **Streamlit Web App:** Provides an interactive dashboard for **EDA & Model Predictions**.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains information on **healthcare spending** by various countries, including:
- **CHE** (Current Health Expenditure)
- **GGHEd** (Government Health Expenditure)
- **PVTD** (Private Expenditure)
- **GDP (USD)** and other financial indicators.

The dataset is sourced from **Google Drive** or **local storage**.
